# LFG Travel Platform - Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
The domain was showing the Trip Creation Wizard instead of the homepage/landing page when users visited the main URL.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Root Route (/)
- **Before**: `app/page.tsx` showed `TripCreationShowcase` component
- **After**: `app/page.tsx` now shows proper landing page with:
  - Hero section with signup/login CTAs
  - Features section
  - How it works section  
  - Social proof section
  - Community showcase section
  - Footer

### 2. Created Protected Trip Creation Route
- **New Route**: `/dashboard/create-trip`
- **Location**: `app/dashboard/create-trip/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Houses the `TripCreationWizard` component
- **Access**: Protected route (requires dashboard access)

### 3. Set Up Authentication Routes
- **Signup Route**: `/auth/signup` → `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- **Login Route**: `/auth/login` → `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- Both routes use existing auth components from `components/auth/`

### 4. Updated Navigation Flow
- **Homepage Hero Section**: 
  - "Start Planning Free" button → `/auth/signup`
  - "Join the Community" button → `/auth/login`
- **Dashboard Quick Actions**:
  - "Create Epic Trip" button → `/dashboard/create-trip`

### 5. Added Route Protection Structure
- Created `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` for future authentication protection
- Set up proper directory structure for protected routes

## User Journey Flow
1. **Visitor lands on domain** → Homepage/Landing Page (`/`)
2. **Clicks "Start Planning Free"** → Signup Page (`/auth/signup`)
3. **After signup/login** → Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
4. **Clicks "Create Epic Trip"** → Trip Creation Wizard (`/dashboard/create-trip`)

## File Structure
```
app/
├── page.tsx                    # ✅ Homepage/Landing Page
├── layout.tsx                  # Root layout
├── auth/
│   ├── login/page.tsx         # ✅ Login page
│   └── signup/page.tsx        # ✅ Signup page
└── dashboard/
    ├── page.tsx               # Dashboard
    ├── layout.tsx             # ✅ Dashboard layout (auth protection)
    └── create-trip/page.tsx   # ✅ Trip Creation Wizard
```

## Next Steps Needed
1. **Implement Authentication**: Add actual auth checks to dashboard layout
2. **Redirect Logic**: Set up proper redirects based on authentication status
3. **Protected Route Component**: Implement full authentication protection
4. **Success Flows**: Handle post-signup/login redirects to dashboard

## Testing
- ✅ Root URL (/) now shows landing page
- ✅ Trip creation moved to protected route
- ✅ Navigation links properly set up
- ✅ Clean separation of public vs protected routes

The routing issue has been resolved - your domain will now show the proper homepage/landing page to new visitors, with the trip creation wizard appropriately placed behind authentication in the dashboard area.
