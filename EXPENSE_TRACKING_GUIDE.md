# 💰 LFG Travel Platform - Expense Tracking & Bill Splitting System

## Overview

The LFG Travel Platform now includes a comprehensive expense tracking and bill splitting system that automatically manages group expenses, calculates balances, and suggests optimal settlements. Think of it as having **Splitwise built into your travel platform**.

## 🎯 What This System Does

### **Simple Explanation**
Imagine you're on a trip with friends. Someone pays for dinner ($120), another pays for taxi ($40), and someone else pays for activities ($200). Instead of manually figuring out who owes what, our system:

1. **Tracks all expenses** with details about who paid and for what
2. **Automatically splits bills** equally among all trip participants  
3. **Calculates balances** showing who's ahead or behind in payments
4. **Suggests settlements** with minimum payments to even everything out

### **Real Example**
**Trip with 3 people: Alice, Bob, and Charlie**

- Alice pays $120 for dinner → Everyone owes $40 each
- Bob pays $60 for taxi → Everyone owes $20 each  
- Charlie pays $90 for activities → Everyone owes $30 each

**Balance Calculation:**
- Alice: Paid $120, Owes $90 → **Owed $30**
- Bob: Paid $60, Owes $90 → **Owes $30**  
- Charlie: Paid $90, Owes $90 → **Even**

**Settlement:** Bob pays Alice $30 → Everyone is even!

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Database Structure**

\`\`\`sql
-- Main expenses table
expenses (
  id, trip_id, payer_id, amount, description, 
  category, expense_date, split_type, split_details
)

-- Individual expense splits
expense_splits (
  id, expense_id, participant_id, amount_owed, paid
)
\`\`\`

### **Service Layer** (`expenseService.ts`)
The core business logic handling:
- ✅ Expense creation with automatic splitting
- ✅ Participant validation and security
- ✅ Balance calculations
- ✅ Settlement algorithm
- ✅ Data retrieval with joins

### **React Hooks** (`useExpenses.ts`)
Easy-to-use React state management:
- ✅ `useTripExpenses()` - Load expense list
- ✅ `useAddExpense()` - Create new expenses  
- ✅ `useTripBalances()` - Calculate participant balances
- ✅ `useSettlements()` - Generate settlement suggestions
- ✅ `useExpenseManager()` - Combined functionality

### **UI Components**
- ✅ `ExpenseInterface` - Complete expense management
- ✅ `AddExpenseModal` - Easy expense creation form
- ✅ Trip expense pages with navigation

## 💡 Bill Splitting Logic Explained

### **How Equal Splitting Works**

\`\`\`typescript
// Example: $120 dinner for 4 people
const totalAmount = 120
const participants = 4
const amountPerPerson = totalAmount / participants // $30 each

// Create splits for each participant
participants.forEach(participant => {
  createSplit({
    expense_id: expenseId,
    participant_id: participant.id,
    amount_owed: 30, // Equal share
    paid: participant.id === payer.id // Payer already paid
  })
})
\`\`\`

### **Balance Calculation Algorithm**

\`\`\`typescript
// For each participant:
const totalPaid = sum(expenses.where(payer_id === participant.id))
const totalOwed = sum(expense_splits.where(participant_id === participant.id))
const netBalance = totalPaid - totalOwed

// Positive balance = owed money
// Negative balance = owes money  
// Zero balance = even
\`\`\`

### **Settlement Algorithm**

Our settlement algorithm uses a **greedy matching approach** to minimize the number of payments needed:

\`\`\`typescript
function generateSettlements(balances) {
  const creditors = balances.filter(b => b.netBalance > 0) // Owed money
  const debtors = balances.filter(b => b.netBalance < 0)   // Owes money
  
  const settlements = []
  
  while (creditors.length > 0 && debtors.length > 0) {
    const creditor = creditors[0]
    const debtor = debtors[0]
    
    // Match them for the smaller amount
    const settlementAmount = Math.min(creditor.netBalance, Math.abs(debtor.netBalance))
    
    settlements.push({
      from: debtor.participantName,
      to: creditor.participantName,
      amount: settlementAmount
    })
    
    // Update balances
    creditor.netBalance -= settlementAmount
    debtor.netBalance += settlementAmount
    
    // Remove settled participants
    if (creditor.netBalance === 0) creditors.shift()
    if (debtor.netBalance === 0) debtors.shift()
  }
  
  return settlements
}
\`\`\`

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Participant-Only Access**
\`\`\`typescript
// Only trip participants can view/add expenses
const participant = await supabase
  .from('trip_participants')
  .select('id')
  .eq('trip_id', tripId)
  .eq('user_id', currentUser.id)
  .eq('status', 'approved')
  .single()

if (!participant) {
  return { error: 'Only trip participants can access expenses' }
}
\`\`\`

### **Payer Validation**
- Only expense creators can delete their expenses
- All expense operations require authentication
- Database-level foreign key constraints

## 🎨 User Interface Features

### **Expense Categories**
\`\`\`typescript
const categories = [
  { id: 'food', label: 'Food & Dining', icon: '🍽️', color: 'orange' },
  { id: 'transport', label: 'Transportation', icon: '🚗', color: 'blue' },
  { id: 'accommodation', label: 'Accommodation', icon: '🏨', color: 'purple' },
  { id: 'activities', label: 'Activities', icon: '🎯', color: 'green' },
  { id: 'shopping', label: 'Shopping', icon: '🛍️', color: 'pink' },
  { id: 'other', label: 'Other', icon: '💰', color: 'gray' }
]
\`\`\`

      ))}
      
      <button onClick={handleAddExpense}>Add Expense</button>
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### **Adding Expenses**
\`\`\`tsx
// Simple expense addition
const result = await addExpense({
  tripId: 'trip-123',
  amount: 75.00,
  description: 'Group breakfast',
  category: 'food',
  expenseDate: '2024-01-15' // Optional, defaults to today
