# Domain Mapping Issue Diagnosis & Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Custom domain `www.lfgetaway.com` shows wrong content (trip creation page), while correct content (homepage) appears at the Vercel auto-generated URL `https://lfgetaway-git-lfgetaway-lfgetaway.vercel.app/`.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Multiple Git Branches with Different Content
- **Main branch**: Contains trip creation wizard showcase page (366 lines)
- **LFGetaway branch**: Contains proper homepage with landing page components (22 lines)
- **Issue**: Different Vercel projects are likely deployed from different branches

### 2. Branch Content Analysis

#### Main Branch (`origin/main`)
- Latest commit: `9a02c4a feat: optimize trip creation wizard for mobile-first design`
- Root page (`app/page.tsx`): **Trip Creation Showcase** (366 lines)
- Shows: Complex trip creation wizard interface
- **This is what's showing on www.lfgetaway.com** ❌

#### LFGetaway Branch (`origin/LFGetaway`) 
- Latest commit: `a882c51 Merge pull request #2 from...`
- Root page (`app/page.tsx`): **Homepage** (22 lines)
- Contains: Landing page components (HeroSection, FeaturesSection, etc.)
- **This is what's showing on the Vercel auto-generated URL** ✅

### 3. Vercel Project Configuration Issue
The custom domain `www.lfgetaway.com` is pointing to a Vercel project that's deployed from the **main** branch, while the auto-generated URL (which shows the correct content) is deployed from the **LFGetaway** branch.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update Main Branch (Recommended)
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the LFGetaway branch into main
git merge LFGetaway

# Push the updated main branch
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Redirect Domain to Correct Vercel Project
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Find the project that's deployed from LFGetaway branch (the one with correct homepage)
3. Add the custom domain `www.lfgetaway.com` to this project
4. Remove the domain from the old project (deployed from main branch)

### Option 3: Update Vercel Project Branch Configuration
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Find the project that has `www.lfgetaway.com` assigned
3. Go to Settings → Git
4. Change the production branch from `main` to `LFGetaway`

## Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Verify Branch Content
```bash
# Check what's on each branch
git checkout main
head -10 app/page.tsx  # Should show TripCreationShowcase

git checkout LFGetaway  
head -10 app/page.tsx  # Should show HomePage with landing components
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Projects
1. Login to Vercel Dashboard
2. List all projects for your account
3. Identify which project has the custom domain assigned
4. Check which branch each project is deployed from

### Step 3: Fix the Issue
Choose one of the solutions above based on your preference:
- **If you want main branch to be the production branch**: Use Option 1
- **If you want to keep branches separate**: Use Option 2
- **If you want to change which branch is production**: Use Option 3

## Prevention for Future

### 1. Set Clear Branch Strategy
- Use `main` branch for production-ready code
- Use feature branches for development
- Always merge to main before deploying to production

### 2. Vercel Project Configuration
- Ensure only one Vercel project is connected to your custom domain
- Set the correct production branch in Vercel settings
- Use branch previews for testing features

### 3. Repository Structure
```
main (production) ← should contain the homepage
├── feature branches
└── LFGetaway (should be merged to main)
```

## ✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETED

### What Was Done
1. **Merged LFGetaway branch into main**: Successfully fast-forwarded main branch to include the correct homepage
2. **Pushed changes to GitHub**: The updated main branch is now deployed
3. **Verified routing structure**: 
   - Root `/` now shows the proper homepage with landing page components
   - Trip creation wizard moved to `/dashboard/create-trip` route

### Expected Results
- **www.lfgetaway.com**: Will now show the homepage (HeroSection, FeaturesSection, etc.) ✅
- **Trip creation**: Available at www.lfgetaway.com/dashboard/create-trip ✅
- **Vercel deployment**: Will automatically update from the main branch ✅

### Files Changed
- `app/page.tsx`: Now contains proper homepage (22 lines vs 366 lines)
- `app/dashboard/create-trip/page.tsx`: Contains the trip creation wizard
- Added proper routing structure with auth and dashboard routes

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes**: Allow Vercel to detect and deploy the changes
2. **Verify**: Check that www.lfgetaway.com shows the homepage
3. **Test navigation**: Ensure trip creation is accessible via proper routing
4. **Clean up**: Consider removing the old LFGetaway branch if no longer needed

## Technical Details

### Current Branch State
- `main`: Trip creation wizard (wrong for production)
- `LFGetaway`: Homepage with landing components (correct for production)
- The LFGetaway branch is ahead of main with proper routing fixes

### Commit History
```
LFGetaway branch:
a882c51 - Merge pull request #2 (Fix routing: Add homepage)
440a331 - Fix routing: Add homepage, create trip route, and auth pages

main branch:
9a02c4a - feat: optimize trip creation wizard for mobile-first design
a8b6735 - Initial commit
```

The LFGetaway branch contains the routing fix that adds the proper homepage, which is what should be on production.
