# 🗓️ Activity Planning & Itinerary Management System

## Overview

The LFG Travel Platform now includes a comprehensive activity planning and itinerary management system that allows trip participants to:

- **Plan activities** with dates, times, and locations
- **Organize itineraries** in chronological daily timelines
- **Track costs** and participant attendance
- **Categorize activities** by type (accommodation, transport, food, etc.)
- **Manage participation** with join/leave functionality

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Schema

**Activities Table:**
\`\`\`sql
activities (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  trip_id: uuid FOREIGN KEY,
  creator_id: uuid FOREIGN KEY,
  title: string NOT NULL,
  description: text,
  location: string,
  category: activity_category ENUM,
  start_date: date NOT NULL,
  end_date: date,
  start_time: time,
  end_time: time,
  cost_per_person: decimal,
  max_participants: integer,
  current_participants: integer,
  booking_url: string,
  notes: text,
  status: activity_status ENUM,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
)
\`\`\`

**Activity Participants Table:**
\`\`\`sql
activity_participants (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  activity_id: uuid FOREIGN KEY,
  participant_id: uuid FOREIGN KEY,
  status: activity_participant_status ENUM,
  joined_at: timestamp
)
\`\`\`

**Enums:**
- `activity_category`: accommodation, transport, food, sightseeing, shopping, entertainment, other
- `activity_status`: planned, confirmed, completed, cancelled
- `activity_participant_status`: interested, confirmed, declined

### Core Components

1. **ItineraryInterface** - Main activity management dashboard
2. **AddActivityModal** - Professional activity creation form
3. **activityService** - Complete business logic layer
4. **useActivityManager** - React hooks for state management

## 📊 **How Activity Scheduling Works (Simple Explanation)**

Think of the activity system like **building a daily schedule for your trip**:

### 1. **Creating Activities**
- Add activities with title, description, location
- Set dates and times (when it happens)
- Choose category (what type of activity)
- Set cost and participant limits
- Add booking links and notes

### 2. **Daily Organization**
Activities are automatically organized into **daily itineraries**:
- Group activities by date
- Sort by time within each day
- Show timeline view (morning → afternoon → evening)
- Calculate daily costs and statistics

### 3. **Participation Management**
- Trip participants can join/leave activities
- Track who's attending what
- Check capacity limits
- See participation rates

### 4. **Cost Tracking**
- Track cost per person for each activity
- Calculate total trip costs
- Show daily spending breakdown
- Average costs per day

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Service Layer (`activityService.ts`)
\`\`\`javascript
// Core functions
activityService.createActivity(activityData)     // Create new activity
activityService.getTripActivities(tripId)        // Load all activities
activityService.getTripItinerary(tripId)         // Organize by day
activityService.joinActivity(activityId)         // Join activity
activityService.getActivityStats(tripId)         // Calculate statistics
\`\`\`

### React Hooks (`useActivities.ts`)
\`\`\`javascript
// Individual hooks
useTripActivities(tripId)     // Load activities
useTripItinerary(tripId)      // Daily organization
useAddActivity()              // Create activities
useActivityActions()          // Join/leave/update/delete

// Combined hook
useActivityManager(tripId)    // Complete system
\`\`\`

### UI Components
\`\`\`javascript
<ItineraryInterface tripId={tripId} />           // Main interface
<AddActivityModal onSubmit={handleSubmit} />     // Activity creation
\`\`\`

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### 1. **Display Trip Itinerary**
\`\`\`jsx
import { ItineraryInterface } from '@/components/activities/ItineraryInterface'

function TripPage({ tripId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Trip Activities</h1>
      <ItineraryInterface tripId={tripId} />
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### 2. **Create Activity Programmatically**
\`\`\`javascript
const { addActivity } = useActivityManager(tripId)

const createSampleActivity = async () => {
  const result = await addActivity({
    tripId,
    title: "Museum Visit",
    description: "Explore local art and history",
    location: "Downtown Museum",
    category: "sightseeing",
    startDate: "2024-03-15",
    startTime: "10:00",
    endTime: "13:00",
    costPerPerson: 25
  })
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Activity created!')
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. **Load Activity Statistics**
\`\`\`javascript
const { stats } = useActivityStats(tripId)

// stats.totalActivities     - Total number of activities
// stats.totalCost          - Total cost for all activities
// stats.averageCostPerDay  - Average spending per day
// stats.categoryCounts     - Activities by category
// stats.participationRate - How many people join activities
\`\`\`
